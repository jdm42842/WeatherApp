# WeatherApp

# Basic weather app I created using DevEd's basic weather app tutorial on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPElVpR1rwA&t=2038s

# Opened by running the index.html file in the preferred browser and rnnning the location based on a person's current coordinates

# Can switch between Fahrenehit and Celsius
